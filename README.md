Some old code to download and plot data from the WHO website.

Working on documentation and linking.

This is also meant to be an example of how the make pipelines work. In theory, you should be able to clone this repo and type `make`, and the project should

* Download the Sierra Leone data from the web site

* Make some plots

* Show the plots on your screen (only in debian/gnome/something?)

For now, the project requires some version of L?[ui]n[ui]x. Volunteers to make windows make files are welcome!

It also requires (please add if you encounter problems)

* wget
* perl
* R

You might also want pdfjam (comes with latex) to mix and match pdf files, but the basic functionality does not depend on this.
